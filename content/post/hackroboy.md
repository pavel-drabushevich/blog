This weekend I had a fun at awesome [Hack Roboy hackathon](https://www.hackroboy.com/) organized by [Roboy team](http://roboy.org/). They create nice robot and it is second event. I've never try to programming robots, so there is new and remarkable experience for me.

Friday evening we start brainstorming ideas (or bearstorming, it is MÃ¼nchen, baby). The most important - we were not alone. Roboy team helps to understand capabilities and push to right way. After that everyone can pitch his or any idea. As result, after one hour there were more that 10 teams. There is limitation: up to 4 person. I'm not very good with social interation, so I decided to state alone. Yes, it is bad idea. As it is. But other teams were completed ideally.

Small team - simple task. Roboy team is working under second Roboy version because current one has some limitation. For example only one muscle for hand, so you can't flex each finger, only all together. I've idea to learn Roboy play Rock-Paper-Scissors. So, scissors is imposible task for him. Fortunately, Li and Christine create hand prototype for version 2 which is a similar as our hand. Please visit their repository: [Anthropomorphic  Dexterous Robotic Hand](https://github.com/Roboy/anthropomorphic-dexterous-robotic-hand) It contains a lot of interesting materials, photos of each stage, 3D models for fingers, arduino code.

As result: almost done for my idea. I just need to modify code a little bit. This prototype based on arduino. It is very good toolkit to prepare some hardware stuff. Also, you can download simple IDEA where you can develop and easy deploy your code to it. As you can see on photo every finger control by 5 servo. When you change angle for one or few of them you trigger movement. It easy. But only because guys already done incredible work to make this hand work.

At second say I decided to work with computer vision and try to understand human result of game. I have not had any experience in opencv so I did not succeed.

But let talk about other teams. They have more cool and ambitious project. There is typical workspace.

I was impressed by Italian teams. Guys came from Italia in Munich to hackathon and not Oktoberfest :) Also they prepared amazing video for demo day. It was so cool that I forgot to photo it. Yes, at Monday every team demonstrate their project.

Two teams decided to help Skynet to destroy humanity :) Both try to detect face (or balloon with face) and destroy it with robo hand or event shoot! But seriously it was very impressive hardware and software project.

One team created very practical project which possible will be included to Roboy version two. They learned robotics legs to hold balance, but not only, even dance a little bit!

Three days is really short time to create such project and team patched it till demo.

Winner project combines several technologies from current Roboy. But guys also found his arms are limited and created another one. Just amazing!

But it was impossible without Roboy team helps. All these day guys were with us and support a lot. Many thanks them! And I wish good luck with new Roboy version.

For myself I found two challenge: buy arduino and try to create something. And dream: I love play piano, so I was inspired by hand prototype and want to create robot who can play piano.
